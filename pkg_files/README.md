# Pkg_Files Folder

## Description

Y'all don't need to pay attention to stuff in this folder.

It's just the various files I need to make packages work

I wanted to support flatpak too, but I couldn't figure it out. The flatpak manifest is too limiting since my app doesn't use just a regular build system, so if anyone can figure that out I'd be appreciative.
