# Adblock Folder

## Description

In here you can find pre-built versions of [blockit.so](https://github.com/dudik/blockit) and [adblock-rust-server](https://crates.io/crates/adblock-rust-server), so you don't have to build them yourself

Obviously, there are links there so you can find their source and everything

Both are licensed under the same LICENSE as this project (GPLv3), and I have made no modifications
