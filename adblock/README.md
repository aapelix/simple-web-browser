# Adblock Folder

## Description

In here you can find pre-built versions of [blockit.so](https://github.com/dudik/blockit) and [adblock-rust-server](https://crates.io/crates/adblock-rust-server), so you don't have to build them yourself

Obviously, there are links there so you can find their source and everything
